# Selaco Archipelago Multiworld Integration

## Research Summary

### Sources Consulted:
- Selaco source code repository (Skuldier/Selaco-ipk3)
- Game files analysis (ACTORS/, zscripts/, MAPINFO)
- Steam App ID: 1966350 (from GAMEINFO.txt)

**NOTE:** Web research was blocked due to network restrictions. This implementation is based on source code analysis only.

### Data Confirmed from Source Code:
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE:** Item classes and progression structure
- **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:** Map structure and naming conventions  
- **LOW CONFIDENCE:** Exact counts and location requirements
- **NONE:** Victory conditions, 100% completion requirements

## Implementation Structure

This integration provides:
1. Complete code for confirmed elements from source analysis
2. Placeholder structure for unconfirmed data marked with TODO
3. Research tools to help complete missing data
4. Validation system that alerts on incomplete data

## Verification Needs

### Required Community Input:
1. Exact collectible counts per map
2. Progression requirements between areas
3. Victory condition confirmation
4. Optional item locations and counts

- Steam achievement guides
- Community speedrun guides
- 100% completion guides

## Confidence Levels

- **HIGH:** Data directly extracted from source code
- **MEDIUM:** Data inferred from code structure
- **LOW:** Logical assumptions based on patterns
- **NONE:** Not implemented (marked as TODO)
