Citing her mother's medical history, Ms. Collins requested a full spectrum of tests for possible hereditary degenerative muscle disease. Ms. Collins displays no physical symptoms of muscle disease. All scans have come up negative, and coupled with her blood work, she is in near perfect health, aside from the initial strains.

I personally assisted on both of these surgeries and both patients were in stable condition in recovery when they died. I've gone back and looked at their charts after the fact and found their deaths have been listed as 'complications from surgery'.\n\nThis is a blatant lie. I can't get a straight answer from anyone and at this point I'm tired of asking. One time could be called a fluke, but twice in so many weeks is the beginning of a pattern. We do everything we can for our patients here and for them to go from healthy and recovering to dead with no clear cause is a shock. I'm not going to point fingers, but being the department head of Nanosurgery, I wanted to inform you of this discrepancy.\n\nNicole Weatherly, RN";

I've reviewed the charts and medical history of both of the patients in question and while the surgeries may have been successful, I have no doubt they died of complications. \n\nI realize such things can come as a shock or a slap in the face to the work you do. Losing a patient never gets easier for anyone involved. The fact of the matter is, while nanosurgery is incredibly safe and effective, there are a non-zero amount of people who are going to have adverse reactions to the introduction of nanobots into their system. \n\nWhile every loss of life is a tragedy, this is the cost of progress. Nanosurgery is far and away the safest and most effective method we have in spite of this.

From what I can gather, it's less than a half dozen deaths in each department, but people are going to start to connect the dots. What are we doing about this? What can we do about this?

However, this weapon's bulky form factor posed difficulties for agents during missions that took place in smaller rooms and corridors. In response, ACE Security requested a lightweight variant from Exon Weaponry on November 13th, 2252, with the crucial stipulation that the new weapon should be smaller and just as deadly, while still retaining the feel of the UC-36.\n\nFollowing numerous iterations and failed attempts, the UC-11 Compact was created on March 15th, 2253. This new weapon is similar to its predecessor in many ways, with nearly identical internal mechanisms and the ability to fire the same bullet cartridge. However, the UC-11 Compact is made from different materials, making it lighter and more maneuverable in close-range encounters. Originally intended to be made with dual-wielding in mind, but this option was discarded due to the unreasonable skill requirements.\n\nAdmiral Tychus thoroughly tested the UC-11 Compact and approved it for service with ACE Security.\n\n\c[OMNIBLUE]Role in your arsenal:\n\c-While it outperforms the UC-36 in terms of raw damage per second, the UC-11 Compact is highly inaccurate due to its design for close-quarters combat. Moreover, this weapon shares ammunition with the UC-36, which may lead to inefficient ammo usage over time. Exercise caution when considering long-term use of the UC-11 Compact.\n\nThe UC-11 Compact comes equipped with a Taser Attachment under the barrel, allowing for the use of melee attacks to shock enemies. If an enemy is punched against a nearby object or wall, a shockwave is emitted that can shock other nearby enemies. However, due to the power of the Taser Attachment, a lengthy charging time is required.";

In these situations, the Grenade Launcher comes equipped with either Tear Gas, Smoke Grenades, or Sleeping Gas.\n\nHowever, in more dire circumstances, EXON Weaponry ensured the production of more lethal grenade types.

Production of these grenades ceased early on. \n\n\c[OMNIBLUE]Role in your arsenal:\n\c-The Grenade Launcher is a powerful weapon capable of effectively damaging or eliminating (multiple) targets with a single shot.\n\nIt features three different grenade types:\n\n\c[orange]Frag\c-: A traditional Frag Shell that inflicts damage to all nearby enemies caught within its blast radius. Its radius is smaller than a M70-V Fragmentation Grenade, but it still packs a punch!\n\n\c[cyan]Ice\c-: The Ice Shell has a much larger area of effect compared to Frag Shells and deals more damage. Weaker enemies who survive the blast will be temporarily frozen, while higher-tier enemies will be weakened with a reduced rate of fire and, in some cases, lose their abilities.\n\n\c[green]Acid\c-: The Acid Shell is a portable weapon of mass destruction. Upon detonation, the area becomes filled with acid, causing extremely high overtime damage and rendering the area inaccessible for a brief period. This is a rare grenade type, so use it sparingly.

Despite its power, its primary intention was never to cause actual harm, but rather to serve as a tool of intimidation. \n\nThis weapon was mostly utilized during moments of crowd control, such as riots, as ACE Security sought non-lethal means to establish a commanding presence in large groups. The strategy involved firing spikes near individuals' feet, as the visual of a spike penetrating far into dense concrete was likely to evoke fear, and, if necessary, performing non-lethal takedowns for incapacitation. These actions often stirred quite the reactions from nearby witnesses, either out of disgust or disrespect.\n\nFor those reasons, ethical considerations came into play. The severe pain and discomfort caused by those unfortunate enough to get hit, ran counter to ACE Security's commitment to a positive public image. For them, it quickly became difficult to justify the existence of a weapon whose sole purpose is to be imposing, rather than practical.\n\nIn 2251, just three years into Selaco's existence, the decision was made to shelve the 24mm HW-Penetrator. Any ACE Security Guard found in possession of this weapon is doing so illegally.";

When used this way, your initial shot will be the most accurate, but any follow-up shots will reduce the accuracy drastically. When the crosshair expands too much, it is advised to cease fire and wait for the weapon to reach a satisfactory level of accuracy again.\n\nTo mitigate some of the DMR's flaws, you can move toward low cover and hold still to attach the bipod onto the surface in front of you. \n\nWith a bipod attached, spread no longer becomes an issue, and zoomed attacks will produce far less recoil. You can still strafe while mounted onto a surface, but once you move away from it, the bipod automatically detaches, and your weapon behaves like normal again.";

However, Starlight's involvement has been kept confidential from the public eye due to the risk of damaging the company's reputation.\n\nUpon removal of the pin, the R.E.D Core System within the grenade initiates a pre-heating sequence. During this sequence, the grenade is ready to be thrown, but still safe for the user to hold for as long as needed.\n\nWhen making impact with any surface, the safety mechanism disengages, triggering the R.E.D Core's instability and leading to a highly potent explosion.\n\nIts devastation is often a lot harder to predict compared to grenades that utilize a traditional fuze.

As I mentioned at the last staff meeting, the next round of our funding comes with a few stipulations from ACE. Given that without this funding we would be forced to lay off 25% of FBF staff, we're moving forward with ACE's proposed improvements.\n\nAt the beginning of next week, two women from ACE's PR department will be taking some pictures of our staff, as well as doing some short interviews. They're going to put together some promotional material for FBF to show average citizens what the investments in our project hold for the future of Selaco.\n\nTo that end, we will also be opening up certain portions of FBF for short tours of the facility. ACE is pushing hard for this one, and I can't really blame them. Transparency is a good thing and the better the public's perception of FBF and our mission, the better chance of increased funding in the future. Some overhauls to our work environment are necessary for this, and I will keep all of you in the loop on that as we sort out those changes. \n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding this.\n\nGavin Crenshaw\nHead of Operations, Full Bloom Florals";

To that end, I've instructed our technicians to install new security and safety measures to protect not only our valued staff, but also the public while touring our facility. We're still a few weeks off from completion of this project, but I'd like for us to start implementing some of these protocols now so that we're all accustomed to these changes before the new system takes effect.\n\nThe largest change will be in the delegation of work to restricted zones. Whereas before you simply had to stay in contact via two way radio when inside a restricted zone, work in these areas will now be doled out to groups of three. \n\nThe entrances to restricted areas will soon be outfitted with pressure plates. A staff member will have to stand on one of these plates to actuate the associated door, where another member will enter to do their work. A third staff member will be on watch, ready to assist or evacuate the worker if the need arises. \n\nThis structure will greatly improve the overall safety of working in a restricted zone, as well as ensure that an errant visitor to our facility can't stumble into any of these areas. \n\nWe will be placing some signs with reminders around these areas, as I realize such a large change will take some getting used to. \n\nI thank each and every one of you for your patience and understanding during this transition. \n\nGavin Crenshaw\nHead of Operations, Full Bloom Florals";

At first I chalked it up to the new lighting they installed down here, but it quickly got out of hand. At this point we're trimming it twice a day just to keep it from choking out the neighboring plants. Its root system is the most troubling part, and I think we need to either kill this one off or move it to a solitary enclosure before the roots overtake all the others planted nearby.

As such, we're going to be expanding to a second station! SPR2 is going to focus not on day to day news and politics, but on historical programming! We want to celebrate the legacy of Earth and offer the citizens of Selaco a bit of nostalgia and hope for a better future. \n\nObviously, we'll be hiring new DJs, sound techs, etc, but in these early days we're simply asking for any contributions our current staff can make. Have ideas for a show? Have some old radio recordings from Earth? Get in contact with Ed Ochsner to see if we can work it in!\n\nThanks to all of you here at Selaco Public Radio!\n\nSidney de Mohrenschildt\nGeneral Manager, SPR";

Some are tv recordings, but we can definitely just rip the audio from them. I know it's bad memories, but I do think it's important to put this sort of thing out there. Let me know if this is something that could work for a broadcast on SPR2, and I'll transfer the files over, although it may take me a little time to find them.
