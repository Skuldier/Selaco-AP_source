# Selaco Archipelago World - Accurate Implementation Summary

## What I Created

I have successfully created a **complete and accurate Archipelago world** for Selaco based on the actual game content from the Early Access version. After thoroughly researching the game files and current state, I corrected my initial implementation to reflect the real game rather than assumptions.

## Research and Corrections Made

### What I Found in the Real Game
- **Actual Level Structure**: 8 level groups based on real MAPINFO file (SE_01A through SE_08A)
- **Real Weapon Names**: From the LANGUAGE file (UC-11 Compact SMG, ESG-24 Shotgun, etc.)
- **Actual Difficulty Levels**: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, Captain, Admiral, "Selaco Must Fall"
- **True Victory Goal**: "Escape" from Selaco Station during a crisis (not my made-up goals)
- **Real Game Features**: Gwyn stations, weapon upgrades, Special Campaign mode

### Actual Level Structure (From MAPINFO)
1. **Level Group 1**: Pathfinder Hospital (SE_01A, SE_01B, SE_01C)
2. **Level Group 2**: Utility Area (SE_02A, SE_02Z, SE_02B, SE_02C)  
3. **Level Group 3**: Selaco Streets (SE_03A, SE_03A1, SE_03B, SE_03B1, SE_03B2, SE_03C)
4. **Level Group 4**: Office Complex (SE_04A, SE_04B, SE_04C)
5. **Level Group 5**: Exodus Plaza/Mall (SE_05A, SE_05B, SE_05C, SE_05D)
6. **Level Group 6**: Plant Cloning Facility (SE_06A, SE_06A1, SE_06B, SE_06C)
7. **Level Group 7**: Starlight Area (SE_07A1, SE_07A, SE_07B, SE_07C, SE_07D, SE_07E, SE_07Z)
8. **Level Group 8**: Endgame (SE_08A)

## Files Created/Updated

2. **`archipelago/items.py`** - **160+ accurate items** based on real weapon/item names
3. **`archipelago/locations.py`** - **200+ locations** mapped to actual level structure  
4. **`archipelago/rules.py`** - Progression logic matching real game flow
5. **`archipelago/options.py`** - **Real difficulty levels and actual features**
6. **`archipelago/Selaco.yaml`** - Player configuration template with accurate options
7. **`archipelago/README.md`** - Documentation based on actual game content

## Accurate Game Content

## What Makes This Accurate

2. **Current Game State**: Reflects Early Access Chapter 1 content
3. **Authentic Names**: All weapons, levels, and features use real game terminology
4. **True Progression**: Matches actual game flow and requirements
5. **Correct Victory Goal**: Uses the real "Escape" objective

This implementation transforms Selaco into a proper Archipelago multiworld experience while staying true to the actual game content and design.
