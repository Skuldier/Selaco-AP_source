- In the future, enemy sprites will instead be recolored to appear frozen. Due to one of our optimization efforts, the engine does not support Color Translations at this time.

- Enemies are now less likely to trigger a stumble animation from body shots, but it's still possible.

<h1>Version 0.86 - Beta</h1>
Thank you for participating in the Beta for the Special Campaign.

Usually we put our changelogs here, but since the Content Patch is still being worked on, having to actively maintain a public log will only slow us down. Once the update is ready, we'll publish a proper changelog with most of the changes we've made over the months!

If you have any feedback about the Special Campaign, whether technical of from a gameplay standpoint, you can contact us on the Steam Forums, Reddit and Discord!

<h1>Version 0.85 - Quality of Life patch</h1>

Happy Three-Month Selaco Anniversary to those who celebrate.

For a more detailed changelog, we highly recommend reading the version we posted on our Steam Community page!

<h2>\c[yellow]Summary\c-</h2>
- Lots of Quality of Life improvements, including backpack reloading, 'Last Weapon' button and more.
- Added Smart Ammo Pickups
- Adjustable difficulty during a campaign
- Improvements to immersion
- Reworked Mutator menu with 3 new mutators
- AI Improvements
- Stagger Rework
- Weapon and enemy balance changes
- Further improved level design
- Vastly improved soundscape with more ambient noises, reworked sound effects, and more
- Rain reworks
- Fan Art Kit

<h2>\c[yellow]Quality of Life\c-</h2>
<h3>Checkpoints</h3>
-  Additional checkpoints have been added to the levels.

<h3>Last-Used Weapon Button</h3>
A 'Last-Used Weapon' keybind has been added
-  Keyboard / Mouse users: The default bind is 'T', but this can be customized.
-  Gamepad / Steam Deck users: Tapping the weapon wheel button now selects the previous weapon. Holding the weapon wheel button opens the weapon wheel as usual.

<h3>Grenade Throwing</h3>
The grenade throwing system was old and a rather sloppy left-over from the days where Selaco was a low quality Doom mod. We have decided to rework this system to make it more snappy and responsive!
-  Completely reworked logic for how grenade throws are detected.
-  Grenade throwing now happens much faster with less windup time.
-  Fixed an error where hitting the grenade button twice would throw another grenade after your previous one.

<h3>Backpack Reloading</h3>
This is a system that many shooters have running in the background. Half-Life 2 is one example. We've added something similar to the game as well.
-  Unequipped weapons will now automatically reload when not used for a duration of time.
-  Backpack reloading is disabled for Hardcore Mode.
-  Added 'Enable Backpack Reloading' option in Gameplay. This is on by default.

<h3>Smart Ammo Pickups</h3>
- Ammo pickups will remain if the full capacity of the pickup is not used. This allows for less ammo to be wasted when picking up ammo while nearing the ammo capacity.

<h3>Dodge Improvements</h3>
In Version 0.84, we introduced a mechanic where making a Sideways Dash would momentarily have bullets phase through you. Visual feedback on whether a dodge was successful was lacking and had to be addressed.

The following things have been added when players do a successful dodge move
- Added a bullet whiz sound effect
- Added a slight rolling effect to the camera
- Added a subtle screen effect
- Added 'Shots Evaded' stat tracker for the Statistics screen

<h3>Stagger Rework</h3>
On higher difficulties, the shooting experience became a lot less fun due to enemies being less likely to stagger. We have addressed this. However, as shown later in the changelog, we've made some difficulty tweaks to compensate.
-  Removed per-difficulty Stagger Chances entirely. Weapons will no longer 'feel' weaker on higher difficulties.
-  Enemies are more likely to stagger when shot by automated weapons.

<h3>Map Screen</h3>
-  Explosive charges are now visible on the automap once you have been close to them.

<h3>Adjustable Difficulty</h3>
-  Added a 'Change Difficulty' menu that can be accessed during the campaign.
-  The lowest selected difficulty during the campaign will be shown on the Chapter 1 completion screen (e.g., playing on Captain, switching to Lieutenant, then switching back to Captain will be considered a Lieutenant playthrough).
-  The difficulty cannot be changed during SMF.

<h3>Healing Stations</h3>
In Selaco, all life is precious! The Allied Coalition for Expansion has taken additional steps to ensure Security Agents remain in healthy condition.
-  All Safe Rooms now have a Healing Station installed which can be used for free (eat that, Gwyn!).
-  Interacting with a Healing Station administers first aid to the player, restoring 10 HP.
-  Healing Stations have a limited supply of first aid. When depleted, they cannot be used anymore.

<h3>Weapon Kits</h3>
-  Taking weapon kits you already own will now give 100 Selver Credits. This should provide players with more money to spend on repeat playthroughs.

<h3>Menu</h3>
-  Most menu descriptions now show the default value.
-  Moved some things around in the Audio Menu. Volume controls are now on top and device settings are below it.

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
-  Health for allies is now displayed as a percentage instead of a flat number (e.g., "315 HP" is now shown as "100% HP").
-  Added engine support for real-time pitch shifting on sound effects that are already playing. This is not used currently, but will be used in the future.

<h3>NEW MUTATOR: Extra Ammo</h3>
-  All ammo pickups in Selaco contain 50% additional ammo. Powerful ammo types like Acid Shells, Railgun Slugs, and more are ignored.

<h3>NEW MUTATOR: Legacy Ammo Pickups</h3>
-  As stated above, v0.85 introduces Smart Ammo Pickups. Use this mutator if you prefer the traditional approach to ammo pickups.

<h3>NEW MUTATOR: Half-Like</h3>
-  Aims to make Selaco more seamless with fewer distractions that get between you and your goal.
-  Removes the 'Secrets Found' stats and no longer informs you when a secret is found.
-  The intermission screen is no longer shown when completing a level.
-  The Chapter Completion screen no longer shows the secret counter.
-  Entering a new level no longer prints the level number. It only prints the area you just entered.

<h3>Mutator Menu Rework</h3>
-  Given the quantity of mutators nowadays, a scrollbar has been added to scroll through mutators.
-  Added category labels to improve navigation. So far, the categories are "Game Modes", "Booster", "Difficulty Modifiers", and "Misc".
-  Added a 'NEW' label for Mutators that are newly added to the game.

<h2>\c[yellow]Immersion\c-</h2>
-  Added collision sound effects when colliding with common props (crates, barrels, etc.).
-  Added an Object Bumping system. Small props will now get kicked out of the way when walking over them.
-  Added Material-Based Body Impacts. Depending on the material an enemy dies on, different effects will spawn (e.g., wood on wooden surfaces, grass blades on grass surfaces).
-  Improved footstep sounds and completely reworked ventilation footstep sounds.
-  Boosted the volume of most ambient effects. They were too subtle and barely audible without headphones.
-  You can now rip posters apart by interacting with them. This adds nothing of value to the game but it's fun.
-  Hundreds of new sound effects have been added, and many outdated sound effects have been reworked to match our newer standards.
-  Added true fall damage for props and decoration actors. For example, bumping a mug off a table will now shatter it once it hits the floor. Prior to this, this was only possible when the player threw them manually.
- Added vacuum cleaning sound for VAC-Bots
- Added proper death sound for Sentry Guns
- Added oil-like decals around the floor for killed robotic enemies

<h3>Muzzle Flashes</h3>
- Player muzzle flashes now fade out a little slower than usual. This makes them more appealing to look at in darker areas
- The Lighting Quality setting now determines the size of the muzzle flashes.
    - LOW and MEDIUM will produce a slightly smaller light effect
    - ULTRA will now produce a brighter light effect


<h3>Rain effects</h3>
-  Added rain puddles.
-  Added Sound Effects when walking over rain
-  Added additional rain splatter effects.
-  Added a 'Rain Quality' setting. Higher values add more rain and spawn additional effects.
-  Added proper directional wind sound effects.
-  Other smaller enhancements.

<h3>Explosion Effects</h3>
-  Explosion effects now take the floor type into consideration. Explosions on a metal surface will spawn pieces of burned metal, wood will spawn plank pieces, etc.
-  Added shattering wood sound effects when explosions happen on wooden surfaces.
-  Enemies killed by grenades now have death animations and no longer always gib.

<h3>Bullet Impacts</h3>
-  Greatly improved impact effects when firing at wood surfaces.
-  Added a 'Metal Chunk' particle effect that occasionally appears when firing at metal surfaces.
-  Improved particle effects when firing at reinforced windows.


<h2>\c[yellow]Balance & Difficulty\c-</h2>
<h3>Captain Difficulty</h3>
-  Increased global enemy damage by 10% to compensate for the vastly increased stagger chances.

<h3>Admiral Difficulty</h3>
The goal of Admiral is to provide a challenging experience even for veteran players of Selaco. Given the changes in v0.85 that make the game slightly easier, this difficulty needed some further tweaking to maintain its high challenge level.
-  Enemies can now deal Critical Strikes. Every bullet has a 10% chance to be a Critical Strike, dealing 25% more damage than regular attacks. Engineers cannot deal Critical Strikes.
-  Increased global enemy damage by 15% to compensate for the vastly increased stagger chances.
-  Enemies are 10% more likely to throw grenades.

<h3>Juggernaut</h3>
A while back we removed his explosive resistance. This was a bad idea and made them pushovers.
-  Juggernaut now has 75% Damage Resistance against Explosive Damage.
-  Juggernauts no longer take full damage from Ice Grenade. The main draw for Ice Grenades against Juggernauts is to cripple his movement abilities and reduce his rate of fire, not dealing damage.

<h3>Riflemen</h3>
-  Increased enemy grenade chance by 5%
-  Ammo Drop Chance reduced from 25 to 20

<h3>Hard-Boiled!</h3>
-  Reduced chance for enemies to drop Weapon Parts.

<h2>\c[yellow]Weapons & Items\c-</h2>
<h3>UC-36 Assault Rifle</h3>
-  Significantly reduced damage randomization. Damage now ranges from 24-32, rather than a dice roll selecting between 14, 32 or 48 damage. This makes the UC-36 more consistent and reliable.
-  Decreased hip fire spread (320 -> 290).
-  Very minor increase (0.1s) in reload time to make the animation look better.
-  Added an improved sound effect when ammo for the UC-36 is running low.
-  FRAMEWORK UPGRADE: Gives slightly more bonus damage (1 -> 2).
-  INCREASED CALIBER: Gives slightly more bonus damage (1-> 2).

<h3>UC-11 Compact SMG</h3>
-  Like the UC-36, reduced the amount of randomized damage per bullet to be more consistent.
-  MAGNETIC ROUNDS: Increased damage against small robots from 30% to 60%.
-  ZOOM: Improved zoom accuracy.

<h3>GRAV-VI Plasma Rifle</h3>
The plasma bolt hitbox was very small and did not match up with the size of the sprite, making it far too easy to miss targets. This has been fixed.
- Increased Plasma Bolt hitbox (7 -> 17)

<h3>S-8 Marksman Rifle</h3>
-  DMR now respects the zoom/toggle zoom setting.
-  EXTENDED ZOOM: Now requires the melee button to be pressed to zoom further instead of the Zoom button.

<h3>Roaring Cricket</h3>
-  Knocking enemies over is no longer baseline.
-  Added 'Knockback' Upgrade. This will be the first upgrade players can get in a Safe Rooms for 60 Weapon Parts.
-  HAIR TRIGGER: Now requires 250 Weapon Parts instead of 60. 

<h3>24mm HW-Penetrator</h3>
A powerful weapon with a near guaranteed chance to stagger enemies. However, given the Stagger rework, its value has dropped a bit. Upping the damage to compensate!
-  Increased base damage (28 -> 33).
-  NAIL BOMB: Decreased damage per nail (28 -> 23)

<h3>Landmines</h3>
- ANNIHILATION MODE: Explosion Range reduced (50% -> 15%)
- ANNIHILATION MODE: Explosion Damage reduced (25% -> 15%)

<h3>Flashlight</h3>
It was a bit too short.
- Increased Flashlight Battery Capacity (100 -> 135)
- Increased Flashlight Battery Recharge Rate (10 -> 20)

<h3>Space Bro</h3>
-  Removed difficulty scaling. Space Bro will now play identically across all difficulties.

<h2>\c[yellow]A.I Improvements\c-</h2>
<h3>Enhanced Grenade Throwing</h3>
Grenade throwing logic for enemies has been improved.
-  Soldiers can now throw grenades at the player's last known position. This allows the soldier to flush out the player if they choose to hide.
-  Soldiers are much better at ensuring the grenade lands near the player.
-  'Hot Drops' have a slightly longer fuse timer to allow more time for the player to evade.

<h3>Stealth Kills</h3>
-  Stealth kills are now more reliable, and melee kills from the back will now insta-kill the enemy.
-  This will become more useful later on in development when enemies have a proper patrolling system.


<h2>\c[yellow]Levels\c-</h2>
<h3>NOTE:</h3> A large amount of stuff has changed. A lot of it unfortunately went undocumented. You may notice plenty of changes while playing through the game again!
-  Moved Exodus Mall Gwyn Station to the entrance of the mall for easier access
-  Fixed a lot of texture alignment errors
-  Fixed numerous soft locks
-  Continued to make improvements toward navigation, signposting, and the general quality of the game.
-  ...And at least a hundred other things.


<h2>\c[yellow]General Improvements\c-</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>
-  Further optimizations have been applied to smoke and particle effects.

<h3>Misc</h3>
-  Added controller rumble when running through glass.
-  Improved visuals when throwing trash in dumpsters.
-  Combat VAC-Bots are now replaced with a regular VAC-Bot when destroyed. However, their turret is gone.
-  Picking up a Combat VAC-Bot will no longer have Dawn point the barrel towards her face. Instead, she will always point it towards the enemy.
-  Added a proper voxel model for dropped miniguns.
-  Added version number to the main menu.
-  Added 'Steam Workshop' info screen to the main menu.
-  Reduced the file size of the game by cleaning up unused assets. This may have saved a bit of VRAM too!


<h2>\c[yellow]Bug Fixes\c-</h2>

<h2>\c[yellow]Modding\c-</h2>

-  Modders can now add mutators and put them into categories



<h1>Version 0.84 - Content Patch #1</h1>
<h2>\c[yellow]Summary\c-</h2>
- The official soundtrack is now available on Steam!
- Added Steam Trading Cards and Points Shop
- Added "Resume Game" button in the main menu
- Added level versioning system
- Added "Hard-Boiled!" mutator
- Added "Armor Up" mutator
- New weapon upgrades
- Weapon kit reworks
- Improved navigation in the earlier levels
- Improved general "feel" of the game
- Improved map screen

- (Experimental) Added "Extended Bullet Casings" graphical setting

- And more!

<h2>\c[yellow]Quality of Life\c-</h2>
<h3>Map Screen</h3>
- Added map icon for weapon kits. They will appear once you have been in their line of sight.
- Added map icon for secrets that have been discovered.
- Added map icon for friendly sentry guns.
- Added option to add textures to the map screen.

<h3>Steam Point Shop</h3>
Not really a change to the game itself, but still worth mentioning!
- Added Steam Trading Cards
- Added Selaco themed backgrounds, stickers and emoji's to the Steam Point Shop 

<h3>Save System</h3>
- Quicksaves and autosaves have been reworked to function properly with Steam Cloud saving. Previously, when using two different machines, some autosaves/quicksaves could be overwritten in the wrong order, which was very confusing.
- Save files will be migrated to a single folder. The first time you launch Selaco, all saves will be backed up and migrated into the program folder so they can properly be synchronized between platforms.
- Steam Deck/Linux and Windows should now be able to synchronize saves correctly.

<h3>Time Saving</h3>
- Added "Skip Spash Screens" options to go straight to the menu after loading the game

<h3>Level Versioning System</h3>
- This system allows us to update the game, including levels, while retaining full saved game compatibility.
- There are some limitations. Any level you have visited in your saved game will still be identical to the version from before the update. Level versioning is only applied to new levels that have not been loaded in your saved game before.
- While we have thoroughly tested this with our playtesters, errors may occur when traveling to previously loaded levels. If this happens, please let us know!

<h3>Credits and Weapon Part UI Elements</h3>
- Credits and Weapon Parts are no longer shown on the HUD at all times.
- Picking up Credits or Weapon Parts will now briefly show your total amount on the HUD.
- Hovering over purchasable items (Gwyn Machines, Purchase Panels) will briefly show the amount of credits.
- You can now see your currency at any time on the Datapad screen.

<h2>\c[yellow]Mutators\c-</h2>
<h3>Updated Mutator Menu</h3>
- We've reworked the difficulty screen to now have a dedicated Mutator button.
- Added a system that allows for unlockable Mutators. This will be explored further later on in our Early Access or v1.0 release.

<h3>New Mutator: Hard-Boiled\c-</h3>
Unlocked by beating Chapter 1.
- All enemies are stronger with slightly more health, pain resistance, ability chances, and mobility options (strafe and flank chances).
- Dawn spawns with the highest possible Tech Module, making all upgrades purchasable right away.
- Killed enemies drop credits and/or Weapon Parts.
- Pathfinder Memorial's Saferoom is unlocked right from the start.
- Enemies will have other surprises that we will not spoil.

<h3>New Mutator: Armor Up\c-</h3>
- Booster Mutator that increases armor durability by 25%.

<h3>Hardcore Mode</h3>
- Save price decreased from 400 to 300.
- Removed Hardcore Mode Mag Dumping. Rather than throw away all the ammo, it will now use the same approach as Traditional Mode. We understand that some people liked this approach, so we are considering adding it back as a separate mutator!


<h2>\c[yellow]WEAPONS, ITEMS & PLAYER\c-</h2>
<h3>All Weapons</h3>
- Added ability to zoom in and out while firing.

<h3>S-8 Marksman Rifle</h3>
- Added distance-based headshot damage. Using the DMR at long range will now eliminate soldiers with a single headshot.
- Slightly increased Reload Speed

<h3>Plasma Rifle</h3>
- Increased base damage (43 -> 48)
- Increased stagger chance per shot (50 -> 70)
- Added sound and lighting effects when killing soldiers with the Plasma Rifle

<h3>Grenade Launcher</h3>
- Increased self-damage by 25%. It was never meant to deal this little damage to the player.

<h3>Penetrator</h3>
- Added an extra sound effect while reloading
- Nail Turret: Reduced damage (21 -> 12)
- Nail Turret: Increased Ammo Capacity (20 -> 25)
DEV NOTE:
Sorry guys, but the Nail Turret was penetrating a little harder than intended

<h3>UC-36 Assault Rifle</h3>
- Reduced maximum spread (5.2 -> 4.8) for improved sustained fire.
- WEAPON KITS:
    | Added 'Burst Fire (Hip)'. Replaces primary fire with a burst fire. This deals +1 damage per shot.
    | Added 'Burst Fire (Zoom)'. Replaces zoom fire with a zoomed burst fire. This has 25% increased accuracy.
    | Removed traditional 'Burst Fire'.
    | 'Scarab Mode' no longer carries over across new campaigns. This upgrade was never meant to be found without cheats.
- Added 'UC-36B Framework' upgrade. This is a free upgrade once you hit Tech Module 3.
- Auxiliary launcher now deals 25% additional grenade damage.
- Improved firing sound to be a bit more punchy.
- Reduced 'Increased Caliber' costs (500 -> 350).

<h3>ESG-24 Shotgun</h3>
- Added 'Quick Swap' upgrade for faster weapon switching to the shotgun.
- Added 'Improved Pump Grip' upgrade for faster shotgun pumping.
- Double Barrel Mode tweak: The first shot has reduced recoil to make it easier to connect both shots.
- Added 'backpack pumping'. Unequiping the Shotgun before pumping will now automatically load a shell. [This is disabled for Hardcore Mode]

<h3>SMG</h3>
- Added 'Mule Stock' upgrade. This will decrease spread but add a little bit of recoil that requires control.
- Added 'Magnetic Rounds'. This increases damage against small robotic enemies, making the SMG even more suitable for clearing Crawler Mines and Saw Drones.
- 'Extended Barrel' now reduces spread by 45 instead of 85. Combined with Mule Stock, you will be able to reduce spread further than before.
- DUAL WIELD: Slightly increased spread per shot

<h3>Fists</h3>
- Added kicks! Hit the melee button when you have your fists out.
DEV NOTE:
We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons. We are looking into some options here.

<h3>Armor Shards</h3>
- Increased pick-up radius to be less clunky.

<h3>Selver Coins</h3>
- Added sound effect when credits spawn into the level (e.g from crates or Hard-Boiled kills)

<h3>Dawn</h3>
- Increased movement speed by 7.5%
- Added 'Invincibility Frames' while dashing. The first couple of frames while dashing will now make Dawn immune to bullets. Any other hazards (like Area of Effect damage or fire) will still hurt Dawn. This effect is brief, but if you can time this with incoming attacks, a lot of damage can be mitigated.
- With dashes being a bit more useful than usual, its cooldown has been increased by 20%.
- Reduced full slide cooldown (3.0s -> 2.5s) to allow for a bit more sliding

<h3>Armor</h3>
- Increased armor durability on Captain, Admiral, and Selaco Must Fall. With the significant increase in damage, they began to lose their worth.

<h2>\c[yellow]ENEMIES\c-</h2>

<h3>Cloning Plant Enemies</h3>
- Melee Types have their health reduced (150 -> 120)
- Ranged Types have their damage reduced (8 -> 6)
- Ranged Types have their health reduced (130 -> 110)
- Dawn can now slide through Plant Enemies. This will allow players to evade when cornered.

<h3>Riflemen</h3>
- Riflemen are now a bit more mobile, mostly in terms of strafing ability
- Their 'martyrdom' grenades that can drop when killed, now explode sooner. They are currently far too slow and barely serve a threat.
- Added visible grenade pin when a 'Martyrdom' grenade is triggered

<h3>Engineers</h3>
- Increased Turret Deployment Chance (4% -> 6%).

<h3>Siegers</h3>
Far too tanky with the amount of mobility and damage they could deal.
- Health Reduced (110 -> 90)
- Siegers are a bit more mobile than before.
- Improved visual spectacle when a Sieger explodes.
- Fixed an error where his explosion would not deal damage.
- Fixed an error where they would spawn more gibs than intended (4 arms or 4 legs)

<h3>Plasma Troopers</h3>
- Reduced Projectile Speed (30-> 26)
- Reduced Armor Penetration (-15% -> -25%) (Meaning Plasma Attacks deal an additional 25% less damage when using armor)

<h3>Juggernauts</h3>
- Increased Leap Explosion Damage (90 -> 110)
- Decreased Leap Explosion Area of Effect (380 -> 280)

<h3>All Robotic Enemies</h3>
- Added black splatter effect when shooting robots

<h3>Airdrones</h3>
- They no longer look away before firing a rocket at you

<h3>Selaco Must Fall</h3>
Too many players managed to beat it, which is not something we tolerate in this mode.       
- Sieger Projectile Speed has been increased by 2.5x
- Enemy Mines now spawn 3 crawler mines when destroyed
- Crawler Mines may now fire an occassional Plasma Bolt
- Added 10% chance for Engineers to fire a rocket instead of a regular shotgun attack
- Enemy Landmines have a much smaller light on them and no longer have Self Lighting
- Saw Drones no longer feel any pain

DEV NOTE:

<h3>Admiral Difficulty</h3>
- Increased Global Damage by 5%

<h2>\c[yellow]LEVELS\c-</h2>

- Streamlined the Lockdown Sequence before fighting Juggernaut. It should now be way easier to navigate through.

<sep/>


<h1>Version 0.83a - EA Update 1 (June 3, 2024)</h1>
This patch focuses entirely on balance changes and bug fixes. We always intended for Selaco to be difficult, that will always the case, but we've taken some steps to make things more fair. Especially on lower difficulty modes which are meant to be more accessible. Thanks for the feedback everyone!

<h3>Improvements / noteworthy changes</h3> 
- Improved the Yellow Barrel section 
- Challenges now reward Weapon Parts instead of Credits

- Added proper model for Yellow Barrels. No more [Placeholder Object]!

- Slightly reduced projectile speed (230 -> 200) 
- Removed 'Prepping a rocket' debug message
